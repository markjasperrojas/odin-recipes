    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bicol Express is a popular, spicy Filipino coconut milk-based stew,
      traditionally made with pork, chili peppers, and shrimp paste. Originating
      in the Bicol region and popularized in Manila, it's known for its creamy,
      savory, salty, and spicy flavor profile, served with steamed white rice to
      balance the heat. While originally a meat and chili stew, variations now
      include seafood, beef, and vegetarian options, with the name inspired by
      the Bicol Express train line.
